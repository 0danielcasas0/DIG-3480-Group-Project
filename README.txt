Team members:
Paige Hemlak, Dylan Paul, Daniel Casas, Jorge Pacheco

Minor - Camera is now relative to the player
Major - Sprint bar added with a cooldown

The biggest challenge I had was adapting the tutorial to the
current version of unity. I had to troubleshoot often,
such as when planning the reach of the npc ghosts.

I will not continue working on this assignment, because I
am proud of how it has turned out.
