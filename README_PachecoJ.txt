The team members involved in this assignment are Jorge Pacheco, Daniel Casas, Dylan Paul, and Paige Hemlak.

The major modification is a sprinting mechanic. When the bar at the bottom is white, you can press shift to activate it. Blue means the sprint is active, red means it's recharging.
The minor modification is camera control. Q and E rotate the camera left and right respectively. Movement code was modified to be dependent on the camera angle.
The biggest challenge I personally faced was getting the player’s movement to be camera-dependent.
I do not believe I will be continuing to work on this, as I would rather move on to other projects. I think the game is in a  good state as it is.
